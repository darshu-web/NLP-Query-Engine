NLP Query Engine: Employee Data Analysis Platform

An AI-powered Natural Language Query (NLQ) engine designed to query both structured (SQL) employee data and unstructured document data. This system dynamically discovers database schemas and uses a Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach for comprehensive data analysis without hard-coded assumptions.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture and Core Components
Backend (FastAPI/Flask)
Component	Responsibility	Key Features
Schema Discovery Service	Connects to SQL database and auto-analyzes schema	Detects tables, columns, types, and foreign keys. Handles naming variations (e.g., emp, employees)
Document Processor	Handles unstructured data ingestion	Supports multiple document types, dynamic chunking, batch embeddings
Query Engine	Core processing pipeline	Classifies queries (SQL vs Document vs Hybrid), generates/optimizes SQL, and implements query caching with intelligent invalidation
Frontend (React/Vue/JS)
Component	UI Features
DatabaseConnector.js	Connection form, schema visualization (tree/graph)
DocumentUploader.js	Drag-and-drop, multi-file support, real-time progress
QueryPanel.js	Query input with auto-suggestions and history dropdown
ResultsView.js	Table view for SQL results, card view for documents, performance metrics display
‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+

Docker & Docker Compose (recommended)

SQL Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite)

Steps

1. Clone the repository

git clone [Your Repository URL]
cd project/


2. Configuration
Create a .env file in the root directory:

# Database connection string
DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./demo_db.sqlite"
# For PostgreSQL: "postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname"

# Embedding model
EMBEDDING_MODEL="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"

# Production settings
CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=300
DB_POOL_SIZE=10


3. Run with Docker (Recommended)

docker-compose up --build


Backend API: http://localhost:8000

Frontend UI: http://localhost:3000

4. Manual Setup (Alternative)

Backend:

cd backend/
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload


Frontend:

cd frontend/
npm install
npm start

üìù Operational Demonstrations
Data Ingestion Flow

Database Connection: Enter DATABASE_URL in the connection panel ‚Üí test connection ‚Üí schema is auto-discovered.

Document Upload: Drag and drop multiple documents (PDF, CSV, etc.) ‚Üí processing progress and indexing displayed in real-time.

Example Queries
Query Type	Example Query	Data Source
Structured (SQL)	"Average salary by department"	Database (aggregations across tables)
Document (RAG)	"Show me performance reviews for engineers hired last year"	Documents (vector search on reviews/resumes)
Hybrid (SQL + RAG)	"Employees with Python skills earning over $100k"	Database + Documents
Complex Aggregation	"Top 5 highest paid employees in each department"	Database (SQL window functions/grouping)
üöÄ Performance and Scaling
Feature	Implementation	Status
Response Time	Optimized SQL + RAG retrieval	< 2s for 95% queries
Concurrency	FastAPI async + connection pooling (DB_POOL_SIZE)	Handles 10+ simultaneous users
Security	Validates and parameterizes queries to prevent SQL injection	Safe for production use
‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

Complex Multi-Table Joins: Extremely complex queries may return a "query too complex" message with suggestions.

Large File Limits: Document uploads limited to 10MB per file. Larger files require dedicated streaming services.
